        Adds information regarding the execution of the instruction, such as operand values, symbols.

        This defines the "default" enhancement of operands - subclasses for specific architecture
        can implement their own logic (override this function), and fallback to this function.
        
        For each operation (instruction.operands), adds the following fields:

            operand.str:
                String of this operand, as it should appear in the disassembly.

            operand.int:
                Integer value of the operand, if it can be resolved, else None.

            operand.symbol:
                Resolved symbol name for this operand, if it can be resolved, else None


        We also add the `info_string` field to the instruction, which contains the string to
        be printed in a disasm view. It can include a symbol (<main+32>), or an address to print.
        Default is None.

        Examples info_string's:
            <main+32>
            [0x7fffffffdfb4] -> 0x2


        Also, in order for the display function to be able to replace any inline address in the operands
        with a symbol, we also add the `symbol` and `symbol_addr` fields.
        This is only set if, after parsing all of the operands, there is exactly one
        value which resolved to a named symbol, it will be set to
        that value. In all other cases, the value is `None`.
